# Course Info App

A React application that displays course information including course name, parts, and exercise counts.

## Features

- **Course Header**: Displays the course name
- **Course Content**: Lists all course parts with their names and exercise counts
- **Total Exercises**: Calculates and displays the total number of exercises across all parts

## How It Works

The app displays information about a course (e.g., "Half Stack application development") including:
- Course name
- List of course parts with their names
- Number of exercises for each part
- Total number of exercises

This project demonstrates React fundamentals including:
- Component composition and structure
- Props and prop passing
- Data rendering
- Component separation (Header, Content, Total components)

# Anecdotes App

A React application that displays programming anecdotes and allows users to vote on them.

## Features

- **Random Anecdote Display**: Shows a random programming anecdote each time you click "next anecdote"
- **Voting System**: Vote for your favorite anecdotes
- **Top Anecdote**: Displays the anecdote with the most votes
- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` hook to manage selected anecdote and vote counts

## How It Works

The app displays a collection of programming-related anecdotes. Users can:
- View a random anecdote
- Vote for the currently displayed anecdote
- See which anecdote has received the most votes

This project demonstrates React fundamentals including:
- Component composition
- State management with hooks
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering

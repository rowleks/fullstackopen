# Unicafe Feedback App

A React application for collecting and displaying customer feedback statistics.

## Features

- **Feedback Collection**: Users can submit good, neutral, or bad feedback
- **Statistics Display**: Shows comprehensive feedback statistics including:
  - Total count of each feedback type
  - Total number of feedback submissions
  - Average feedback score
  - Percentage of positive feedback
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displays "No feedback given" when no feedback has been collected yet

## How It Works

The app simulates a feedback system (like a cafe feedback form) where users can rate their experience. The statistics are calculated in real-time and displayed in a table format.

This project demonstrates React fundamentals including:
- Multiple state variables
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Component composition
- Data calculations and formatting
